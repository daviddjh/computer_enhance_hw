## Progress:

HW 1 - Done! Intel syntax has destination registers on the left hand side, like c has destination on left hand side of equals sign
8086 manual: https://edge.edx.org/c4x/BITSPilani/EEE231/asset/8086_family_Users_Manual_1_.pdf

HW 2 - Done! Op Codes can be decoded many different ways, depending on flags in the rest of the instruction. Some features can only be used with certain registers. Lookup tables are not always as consistent as one might expect. These oddities make the manual absolutely nessesary for decoding instructions.
